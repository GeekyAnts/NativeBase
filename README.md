## 5. Inspirations

## 6. API

Declarative and Imperative. Declarative for components and Imperative for all the actions

## 7. Getting Started

To have `NativeBase` components running onto your native apps, all you need to do is, create a fresh React Native project using whatever you want, [expo](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/) is a really great starting point so we will start with that and install the NativeBase using `npm` or `yarn` and add all the peer dependencies.

## Setup with React Native

```bash
react-native init AwesomeNativeBase
cd AwesomeNativeBase
```

*Install **NativeBase***

```bash
# using yarn
yarn add native-base@next
```

```bash
# using npm
npm i native-base@next
```

*Install **Peer Dependencies***

The peer dependencies included from any npm packages does not automatically get installed. Your application will not depend on it explicitly.

```bash
react-native link
```

You've successfully setup [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) with your [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) app. Your React Native app is ready to run on iOS and Android devices.

## Setup with Expo

Expo helps you make React Native apps with no build configuration. It works on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Refer this link for additional information on [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/) and setting up an Expo starter app.

*Install **NativeBase***

```bash
# using yarn
yarn add native-base@next
```

```bash
# using npm
npm i native-base@next
```

**We will also have to install these peer dependencies**

*Install **react-native-svg***

```bash
# using yarn
yarn add react-native-svg
```

```bash
# using npm
npm i react-native-svg
```

*Install **react-native-vector-icons***

```bash
# using yarn
yarn add react-native-vector-icons
```

```bash
# using npm
npm i react-native-vector-icons
```

*Install **styled-components***

```bash
# using yarn
yarn add styled-components
```

```bash
# using npm
npm i styled-components
```

*Install **styled-system***

```bash
# using yarn
yarn add styled-system
```

```bash
# using npm
npm i styled-system
```

## 8. Components
