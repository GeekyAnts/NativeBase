[NativeBase](http://nativebase.io/) is a free and open source framework that enables developers to build high-quality mobile apps using [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) iOS and Android apps with a fusion of [ES6](http://es6-features.org/#Constants). NativeBase builds a layer on top of React Native that provides you with basic set of components for mobile application development. This helps you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms. [Read More. . .](http://nativebase.io/documentation)

What is really great with [NativeBase](http://nativebase.io/) is that you can use shared UI cross-platform components, which will drastically increase your productivity.
