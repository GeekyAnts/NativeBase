Essential cross-platform UI components for React Native

#### Updated docs [here!](http://nativebase.io/docs/v2.0.0)

![Demo](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase-KitchenSink/raw/master/Screenshots/iOS/demo.gif)

NativeBase is a sleek, ingenious and dynamic front-end framework created by passionate React Loving team at [Geekyants.com](http://geekyants.com/) to build cross platform Android & iOS mobile apps using ready to use generic components of React Native.

### Note about `Icon`

Icon is a wrapper around [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) and uses `Ionicons` as the default iconFamily. To change the icon family you have to set it in the [theme](http://nativebase.io/docs/v0.5.13/customize#themingNativeBaseApp) [variable file](http://nativebase.io/docs/v0.5.13/theme-variables). Other iconfamilies (like FontAwesome) won't work out of the box unless the variable file is changed.
