## 1. Introduction?

[NativeBase](https://nativebase.github.io/) is a mobile-first, component library for React & React Native. Version 3.0 ships with complete ARIA integration, support for utility props and nearly 40 components that are consistent across Android, iOS and Web. Fast-track your dev process with NativeBase 3.0.

**Recommended by [Awesome React Native](https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native)**

> NativeBase was added to the list of Frameworks of Awesome React Native and it is used by numerous React lovers across the world.

## 2. Motivation

Building with React Native from scratch is a tedious process with multiple steps such as adding styling, interactions, state management, responsiveness, accessibility, etc. We wanted to build and ship accessible, high-quality apps quickly.
<br />

Our inspirations include Material UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design, Braid Design System, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS & Flutter.

## 3. Features

### **Out of the Box Accessibility**

Integrated with React ARIA and React Native ARIA, which provides React hooks. This enables you to build accessible design systems in no time.

### **Supporting Utility Props**

Powered by [Styled System](https://styled-system.com) so you can rapidly build custom UI components with constraint-based utility style props.

### **Rich Component Library**

NativeBase offers around 40 components so you can build seamlessly. It includes button, checkbox, flex, stack and more.

### **Highly Themeable**

Themeability is one of the core elements of NativeBase. You can customise your app theme and component styles to your heart's content.

### **Available for Both Mobile and Web**

NativeBase 3.0 is powered by React Native Web so you can build consistent UIs across Web, Android and iOS.

### **Responsiveness Made Easy**

Instead of manually adding responsiveness, NativeBase 3.0 allows you to provide object and array values to add responsive styles.

### **Now with** **Dark Mode**

Building apps with a dark mode setting just got a whole lot easier. NativeBase is now optimised for light and dark modes.
