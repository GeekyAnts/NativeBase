# Contributing to NativeBase

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the [NativeBase](http://nativebase.io/) project!

In favor of active development, we accept contributions from everyone. NativeBase team is constantly marking issues and features that the community can implement. You can contribute by submitting a bug, creating pull requests or even by improving documentation. Beneath is the manual to be accompanied strictly earlier than submitting your pull requests / issues.

Take a look at [NativeBase on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/native-base)

### 1. Coding Style

To keep project away from disputes we make use of **ESLint**, which is really a handy linting tool that enforces strict coding styles and makes sure your files are free from dead code. Each module of NativeBase has bundled ESLint as a dev dependency.

In order to lint your code run following command.

```
cd AwesomeNativeBase

npm install eslint
```

### 2. Git Flow

NativeBase is an infant and growing rapidly, so we planned to stick to Git Flow. Below are the rules you need to follow:

#### a. Reporting Bugs

- Always update to the most recent `master` release, the bug may already be resolved.
- Search for similar issues in the issues list for this repo. It may already be an identified problem.
- If you want to contribute to an issue that is not part of this list, you are welcome to submit [new issue](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/issues/new) to our GitHub Repository.
  - In that case, provide a short description of the visible symptoms. Include error messages, screenshots, and stack traces.
  - If applicable, submit a step-by-step walkthrough of how to reproduce the issue.
- In any case, a **closed issue** is not necessarily the end of the story! If more info becomes available after an issue is closed, it can be reopened for further consideration.

#### b. Request for New Feature

- Use [Github Issues](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/issues) to submit feature requests.
- Search for a similar request and extend it if applicable. This way it would be easier for the NativeBase community to track the features.
- When a fresh new feature is requested, try to give as many details on your need as feasible. We prefer that you explain the need rather than explaining a technical solution for it. That might trigger a nice conversation on finding the best and broadest technical solution to a specific need.

#### c. Code Fixes and Enhancements

- Before submitting a pull request, we appreciate if you create an issue first to discuss the change.
- Fork the repo you are planning to work on.
- Create a new branch from branch `master`.
  - Example: `my-new-feature`
  - Note: Please have your branch named apart from `master` and `development`.
- Work on your branch until you are confident enough to create a pull request.
- Conclude working on your branch and push to your forked repo.
- Create a pull request of your branch to NativeBase repo `master` branch.
- Provide a short description of the necessity and functionality of your PR. Include a step-by-step walkthrough of it with an use case example.
- Link the issues that are related to your PR in the body.
- If you have perfectly accompanied our contribution guide and that if your new feature / bug fixes sounds good to us, then we will merge the changes and you are free to delete your branch.
- After your contribution is merged, itâ€™s not immediately available to all users. Your change will be shipped as part of the next release.

Check the procedure to setup the Development Environment for NativeBase.

**Note:** NativeBase changes a lot and is in constant mutation. We usually merge multiple PRs per day, so sometimes when we are done reviewing, your code might not work with the latest `master` branch anymore. To prevent this, before you make any changes after your code has been reviewed, you should always rebase the latest changes from the `master` branch.

### Working with Git

We recommend having two remotes for your Nativebase project, `origin` which would be your fork and `nativebase` which is the main repo.
(more details in development enviromnent below)

Once your work is done, it's time to clean up your feature branch's
commit history. As a rule of thumb, each contribution should be squashed into
_one_ commit with a
[high-quality commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit).

There are [many](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset)
[mechanisms](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3697178/git-merge-all-changes-from-another-branch-as-a-single-commit)
to rewrite Git commit history, but we use
[interactive rebasing](https://help.github.com/articles/using-git-rebase-on-the-command-line).

First, ensure your local `master` branch contains the latest changes:

```git
git checkout master
git fetch nativebase
git merge nativebase/master
```

Next, invoke Git's rebase tool in interactive mode:

```git
git checkout your_branch
git rebase -i master
```

This will open a text editor with a listing of all commits performed in your
feature branch. You'll usually want to `reword` your feature branch's original
commit and `fixup` subsequent ones.

> You may need to resolve conflicts during the rebase operation. This can occur
> if commits were pushed to `master` while you were working on your
> contribution.

Use `git log` to double-check that your contribution has been squashed into a
single commit.

You are now ready to send PR to NativeBase!

### 3. Development Environment

- Fork this repository.

- Move over to the TestBed App [here](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/native-base-testbed) and clone it:

  ```bash
  cd native-base-testbed and npm install
  ```

- Clone your fork of NativeBase:

  ```git
  git clone git@github.com:${YOUR_USERNAME}/NativeBase.git
  ```

- Navigate to NativeBas:e

  ```
  cd NativeBase/
  ```

- Add main repo remote:

  ```git
  git remote add nativebase git@github.com:GeekyAnts/NativeBase.git
  ```

- Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

* Navigate to your app:

  ```
  cd ../
  ```

  and start making the changes.

Happy hacking!
