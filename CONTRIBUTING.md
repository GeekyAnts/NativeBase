# Contributing to NativeBase

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the [NativeBase](http://nativebase.io/) project!

In favor of active development, we accept contributions from everyone. NativeBase team is constantly marking issues and features that the community can implement. You can contribute by submitting a bug, creating pull requests or even by improving documentation. Beneath is the manual to be accompanied strictly earlier than submitting your pull requests / issues.

Take a look at [NativeBase on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/native-base)


## Manual

    - [Request for New Feature](#b-request-for-new-feature)
    - [Code Fixes and Enhancements](#c-code-fixes-and-enhancements)


### 1. Coding Style

To keep project away from disputes we make use of **ESLint**, which is really a handy linting tool that enforces strict coding styles and makes sure your files are free from dead code. Each module of NativeBase has bundled ESLint as a dev dependency.

In order to lint your code run following command. 

```
cd AwesomeNativeBase

npm install eslint
```


### 2. Git Flow

NativeBase is an infant and growing rapidly, so we planned to stick to Git Flow. Below are the rules you need to follow:

#### a. Reporting Bugs

-	Always update to the most recent `master` release; the bug may already be resolved.
-	Search for similar issues in the issues list for this repo. It may already be an identified problem.
-	If you want to contribute to an issue that is not part of this list, you are welcome to submit [new issue](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/issues/new) to our GitHub Repository.
	-	In that case, provide a short description of the visible symptoms. Include error messages, screen shots, and stack traces.
	-	If applicable, submit a step-by-step walkthrough of how to reproduce the issue.
-	In any case, a **closed issue** is not necessarily the end of the story! If more info becomes available after an issue is closed, it can be reopened for further consideration.


#### b. Request for New Feature

-	Use [Github Issues](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/issues) to submit feature requests.
-	Search for a similar request and extend it if applicable. This way it would be easier for the NativeBase community to track the features.
-	When a fresh new feature is requested, try to give as many details on your need as feasible. We prefer that you explain the need rather than explaining a technical solution for it. That might trigger a nice conversation on finding the best and broadest technical solution to a specific need.


####c. Code Fixes and Enhancements

-	Before submitting a pull request, we appreciate if you create an issue first to discuss the change.
-	Fork the repo you are planning to work on.
-	Create a new branch from branch `master`.
    -  Example: `my-new-feature`
    -  Note: Please have your branch named apart from `master` and `development`.
-	Work on your branch until you are confident enough to create a pull request.
-	Conclude working on your branch and push to your forked repo.
-	Create a pull request of your branch to NativeBase repo `master` branch.
-	Provide a short description of the necessity and functionality of your PR. Include a step-by-step walkthrough of it with an use case example.
-	Link the issues that are related to your PR in the body.
-	If you have perfectly accompanied our contribution guide and that if your new feature / bug fixes sounds good to us, then we will merge the changes and you are free to delete your branch.
-	After your contribution is merged, itâ€™s not immediately available to all users. Your change will be shipped as part of the next release.


**Note:** NativeBase changes a lot and is in constant mutation. We usually merge multiple PRs per day, so sometimes when we are done reviewing, your code might not work with the latest `master` branch anymore. To prevent this, before you make any changes after your code has been reviewed, you should always rebase the latest changes from the `master` branch.
